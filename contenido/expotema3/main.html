			<h1>Chapter 3:</h1> <br>
			<p>The HTML5 Canvas Text API allows developers to render text on an HTML page in
ways that were either tricky or next to impossible before its invention.
We are providing an in-depth analysis of the HTML5 Canvas Text API because it is one
of the most basic ways to interact with the canvas. However, that does not mean it was
the first Canvas API feature developed. In fact, for many browsers, it was one of the last
parts implemented.</p>
<br>
<p>
	There was a time in the recent past when HTML5 Canvas Text API support in browsers
was spotty at best. Back then, using modernizr.js to test for text support would have been
a good idea. However, at this historic moment, all modern browser versions support
the HTML5 Canvas Text API in some way.
This chapter will create an application named “Text Arranger” to demonstrate the features
and interdependencies of the HTML5 Canvas Text API. This application will display
a single line of text in an almost infinite number of ways. This is also a useful tool
to see whether support for text is common among web browsers. Later in this chapter,
you will see that some text features are incompatible when drawn on the canvas at the
same time.
</p> <br>

<h1>Canvas Text and CSS</h1> <br>
<p>
	The first thing you need to know about text on HTML5 Canvas is that it does not use
CSS for style. While the properties of HTML5 Canvas look similar to CSS properties,
they are not interchangeable. While your knowledge of CSS will help you understand
text on the HTML5 Canvas, you can’t rely solely on that knowledge to be successful with
Canvas text. That being said, Canvas can take advantage of fonts defined in a CSS file
using @font-face, and can fall back to multiple different fonts if the defined font is not
available.
</p> <br>

<h1>Displaying Basic Text</h1> <br>
<p>
	Displaying text on HTML5 Canvas is simple. We covered the basics in Chapter 1. Here,
we will review these basics, and then we will show you how to make them work with
the Text Arranger application.
</p> <br>

<h1>Basic Text Display</h1> <br>
<p>The simplest way to define text to be displayed on the canvas is to set the con
text.font style by using standard values for CSS font style attributes: font-style,
font-weight, font-size, and font-face.</p><br>
<p>We will discuss each of these attributes in detail in the upcoming section “Setting the
Text Font” on page 89. All you need to know now is that a font designation of some type
is required. Here is a simple example of setting a 50-point serif font:</p><br>
<p>context.font = "50px serif";</p><br>

<p>You also need to set the color of the text. For filled text, you would use the context.fill
Style attribute and set it using a standard CSS color, or with a CanvasGradient or
CanvasPattern object. We will discuss the latter two options later in the chapter.
Finally, you call the context.fillText() method, passing the text to be displayed and
the x and y positions of the text on the canvas.
The following is an example of all three basic lines of code required to display filled text
on HTML5 Canvas:</p><br>

<p>context.font = "50px serif"</p>
<p>context.fillStyle = "#FF0000";</p>
<p>context.fillText ("Hello World", 100, 80);</p><br>

<p>	If you do not specify a font, the default 10px sans-serif will be used automatically.</p><br>

<h1>Handling Basic Text in Text Arranger</h1><br>

<p>For Text Arranger, we are going to allow the user to set the text displayed by the call to
context.fillText(). To do this, we will create a variable named message where we
will store the user-supplied text. We will later use that variable in our call to con
text.fillText(), inside the standard drawScreen() method that we introduced in
Chapter 1 and will continue to use throughout this book:</p><br>

<p>var message = "your text";</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>function drawScreen() {</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>context.fillStyle = "#FF0000";</p>
<p>context.fillText (message, 100, 80);</p>
<p>}</p> <br>

<p>To change the text displayed on the canvas to the text entered by the user, we need to
create an event handler for the text box keyup event. This means that whenever someone
changes text in the box, the event handler function will be called.
To make this work, we are going to name our text box in our HTML form using an
input form element. Notice that the id is set to the value textBox. Also notice that
we have set the placeholder="" attribute. This attribute is new to HTML5, so it might
not work in every browser. You can also substitute it with the value="" attribute, which
will not affect the execution of this application:</p><br>

<h1>Communicating Between HTML Forms and the Canvas</h1> <br>

<p>Back in our JavaScript code, we need to create an event handler for the keyup event of
textBox. We do this by finding the form element by using the document.getElement
ById() function of the DOM document object and storing it in the formElement variable.
Then we call the addEventListener() method of formElement, setting the event to
keyup and the event handler to the function textBoxChanged, which we have yet to
define:</p><br>

<p>var formElement = document.getElementById("textBox");</p>
<p>formElement.addEventListener('keyup', textBoxChanged, false);</p> <br>

<p>
	The final piece of the puzzle is to define the textBoxChanged() event handler. This
function works like the event handlers we created in Chapter 1. It is passed one parameter
when it is called, an event object that we universally name e because it’s easy to
remember.
The event object contains a property named target that holds a reference to the HTML
form element that created the change event. In turn, the target contains a property
named value that holds the newly changed value of the form element that caused the
event to occur (that is, textBox). We retrieve this value and store it in the message
variable we created in JavaScript. It is the very same message variable we use inside the
drawScreen() method to paint the canvas. Now, all we have to do is call
drawScreen(), and the new value of message will appear “automagically” on the canvas:
</p><br>


<p>function textBoxChanged(e) {</p>
<p>var target = e.target;</p>
<p>message = target.value;</p>
<p>drawScreen();</p>
<p>}</p>
